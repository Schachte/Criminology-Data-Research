# GIT Basics

## Pushing Code to Repository

`git branch` Check the current branch that we are in

```
git checkout 'branch_name' (Switch the current branch)

git checkout -b 'new_branch_name' (Make a new git branch)

git pull origin master (Pulls in the most recent changes from the github server)

git status (Checks all the changes that were made to the new repo)

git add * (Add all those changes to push up)

git commit -m "messag_here" (Add the committed changes to staging w/ a message)

git push origin [YOUR_BRANCH_NAME] (Push the new code to the server)
```
